# WORLDCUP DATABASE
## Relational Database Certification by FreeCodeCamp

This is one of the required projects to earn the Relational Database Certification from freeCodeCamp

### Project Description
In this project I created a Bash Script (file: insert_data.sh) that enters information from World Cup games into the worldcup database with PostgreSQL, along with queries to it for useful statistics by answering predefined questions (file: queries.sh).

### Rebuilt the Database
This database was dumped into the file worldcup.sql. So the database may be rebuilt by entering psql -U postgres < worldcup.sql in a terminal where from the path the .sql file is located.
